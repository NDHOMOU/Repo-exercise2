What is version control?
Version control is a system that records all changes and modifications to  files for tracking purposes. Developers also use the term source control or source code management. The primary goal of any version control system is to keep track of changes.

Benefits associated with version control:
-Revision History
-Identity
-Collaboration
-Automation
-Efficiency

Systems of version control: Centralized & Distributed
-Centralized version control systems, or CVCS for short, contain a server and a client. The server contains the main repository that houses the full history of versions of the code base.
-Distributed version control systems or DVCS for short, are similar to the centralized model. You still need to pull code down from the server to view the latest changes. The key difference is that every user is essentially a server and not a client. This means that every time you pull down code from the distributed model, you have the entire history of changes on your local system.
